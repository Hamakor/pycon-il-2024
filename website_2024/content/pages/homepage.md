  <h2>About PyCon Israel</h2>
  <p>
PyCon Israel is a conference dedicated to the Python
programming language, related technologies, and their use. It
is an event for practitioners to share knowledge and
experiences, an opportunity to network, and an occasion to
have some fun.
  </p>
  <p>
The conference is the largest gathering of this community in
Israel. It is held annually, almost every summer since
2016. In the spirit of Open Source, it is produced by a team
of volunteers, under the auspices of Hamakor, the Israeli Free
Software and Open Source organization.
  </p>
  <p>
PyCon is a diverse conference dedicated to providing an
enjoyable experience to everyone - and features international
keynote speakers and talks from local Python experts, as well
as community-building activities.
